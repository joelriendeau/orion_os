A collection of numerial coordinate conversions.

For example, conversions from/to Earth-Centered coordinates (xyz) to Longitude, Latitude and Altitude on a reference ellipsoid;
projections from/to LonLatAlt to Transverse Mercator projections, etc.

This code should be kept highly portable, because it will probably be referenced both from on-board ARM code, Windows Mobile applications and Desktop applications.
