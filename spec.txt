Specification for OrionRTK's main board software
------------------------------------------------
Runs on Orion1040 Rev 1 board, over NXP's LPC3230 Arm processor.

This software will act as the control point for all the devices making up a Base Station or Rover unit.
It will provide, through a protocol running over BlueTooth, SerialPort or USB :
 - real-time kinematics positioning data
 - configurable parameters
 - statistics and status of the system

This software will run as many loops :
 - The main communication loop, itself possibly launching lightweight threads for answering.
   This part may be coded using a higher level language than C or C++, probably Lua
 - The computing thread solving a RTK solution

Two main configurations are planned, selectable through preprocessor definitions in the main files shared between the two :
 - Base Station : No support for receiving and BlueTooth, only sends data through the radios save for debugging, limited usage for the IMU
 - Rover : Support for everything

Support for the following hardware :
 - Flash memories, NAND and NOR
 - DDR
 - microSD
 - Radios, long and shoft range
 - PIC controller, for both power supply stats and RFID interrupts
 - BlueTooth
 - GPS board with timepulse
 - IMU board
 - USB
 - SerialPort, debug and comm
 - LEDs and buttons
 - Temp sensors
